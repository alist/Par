/* ParDoc is a shared char* on _chr -- ParDoc is SINGLE THREADED -- see below
 * Many - many ParDocs may point to the same _chr, which is useful for backtracking.
 * As the Par matches words in grammar, it advances the cursor and adds another ParDoc 
 * on the stack. For a non-match, Par backtracks pops prior versions of ParDoc off the stack.
 * Because all ParDocs point to the samem _chr, there are no copies needed.
 *
 * There is a special case for lookahead parsing; for example: cd in
        
    a(b ~cd e)
    cd (c d) 
    c('c') 
    d('d') 
    e('e')
 
 * where ~cd needs to match 
 
    "b c d e" // "c d" occuring before "e"
 
 * but not match 
 
    "b e c d" // "c d" occuring after "e"
 
 * There are two approaches: slow and fast.
 * Slow approach is to create a new string "c d" and delete after subparse;
 * Fast approach is to terminate before lookahead match: "b c d" + '\0' + "e"
 * Given the overhead for new() and free(), a fast single-thread probably
 * outperforms a slow multi-thread for most grammars and documents, so
 * ParDoc uses the fast approach. This, ParDoc is NOT THREADSAFE for 
 * lookahead (only). See pushCutHack and popCutHack for details.
 *
 * Island parsing is not affected, because the unmatched portion of _chr
 * is copied to a newr "unmatched" token and then handled after tokenizing.
